# Database Management Course System

## Description

This project is a training example designed for educational purposes, particularly for teaching the fundamentals of database management. The system demonstrates the integration of a web application with a MySQL database, showcasing essential operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data (CRUD).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Pip (Python package manager)
- MySQL Server

## Installation

### MySQL Setup

#### Windows:

1. **Download MySQL Installer**: Go to the [MySQL Downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) and download the MySQL installer.
2. **Install MySQL**: Run the installer and follow the prompts to install MySQL. During installation:
   - Choose a setup type (Full, Developer, Server only, etc.).
   - Set up a root password when prompted.
   - Optionally, install MySQL Workbench.

#### macOS:

1. **Download MySQL**: Visit the [MySQL Downloads page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and download the MySQL Community Server for macOS.
2. **Install MySQL**: Open the downloaded DMG file and follow the installation instructions.
3. **Set Root Password**:
   - Open Terminal.
   - Start the MySQL server with `sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start`.
   - Secure MySQL with `sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_secure_installation`.
   - Follow the prompts to set a root password.

### Python and Project Dependencies

1. **Clone/Download the Project**: Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**:
   - Windows: `python -m venv venv`
   - macOS: `python3 -m venv venv`
4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Configuration

1. **Database Setup**: Use the provided SQL script to set up your database schema. This can be done through MySQL Workbench or the command line.
2. **Application Configuration**: Modify the `config.ini` file with the correct database credentials and other necessary configurations.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask App**: Run `python app.py` (Windows) or `python3 app.py` (macOS) from the project directory.
2. **Access the App**: Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
